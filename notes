notes :

* make blocks just in refresh
* make sudoku matrix have original values after generation and check if input equals value in matrix for errors 




1) Solving a sudoku:
    for each cell :
    keep trying a number from 1-9 until it does not break any sudoku rule

2) Generating a sudoku:
  q1) what is the minimum number of cells to filled in order to have a solvable sudoku?
  q2) what is the coordination of filled cells that have only one unique solution?

  1) i can start with a generated sudoku that is valid which means that every cell is not breaking any sudoku rule and every cell is filled ,
  then i remove a number of cells in different positions.
  the number of cells removed is directly related to the difficulty of the puzzle and *the uniqueness of the puzzle*.
  the position of the cells that is removed is also a factor of the solvability of the puzzle or the uniqueness of the solution for the puzzle.




3) add pencil marks

4) colors and shit

5) menu and ending (GUI)

6) we can add a sudoku puzzle from photo were u upload a photo and it replicates the puzzle just from the photo

7) move with keyboard
